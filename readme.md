# Proxy Re-Encryption for Accelerator Confidentiality in FPGA-Accelerated Cloud

This repository is provided to support the _Proxy Re-Encryption for Accelerator Confidentiality in FPGA-Accelerated Cloud_ paper [2020/805](https://ia.cr/2020/805).

The underlying cryptographic primitives rely on [Relic Toolkit](https://github.com/relic-toolkit/relic.git). The `prepare.sh` is provided for installation of it and setting the environmental variables accordingly. Afterwards, you can use the `proxyre` directory and corresponding `Makefile` to play with the protocol.
